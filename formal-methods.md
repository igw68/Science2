# Formal methods

Here are some references and talks about why formal methods are  interesting

From "Formal Methods Manifeso 2010:
+ find an application area  for your tool as no tool can be universal. Work on higher degree of automatisation.
+ Quoting from Tom Ball’s presentation at the workshop, we understand that tools implementing formal methods are still too hard to use. Simple counterexamples and simple proofs are needed, as are predictable behavior to avoid wild swings in performance for small changes. Tools should explain their failures so that users know what to do next. Type systems are a particularly successful example satisfying these requirements. Finally, we should learn to build on each other’s work and stop reinventing the wheel!
