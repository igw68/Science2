Infinite state systems/language theory/databases

## Synchronized tuples

## Hierarchical data XML
He studies XPath. 
	It has horizontal and vertical navigation. It has path and node expressions
	they denote binary and unary expressions. 
	It can test equality of data in nodes.

Satisfiability problem for fragments of XPath.
Navigational fragments: he studied probably all of them
Logic LRV: simplification of data testing (comparing current node with
descendants or ascendants)
On data words the sat is equivalent to VAS
On k-ranked trees it is equivalent to BVASS
**Q:** it is not clear what is the model of BVASS corresponding to LRV.

## Graph databases
Finite graph with labeled edges and nodes.
Conjunctive regular path queries
Containment problem (study fragments): restricting skeletons or regular language
Boundedness problem: is there equivalent query that does not use recursion
(transitive closure)
Ontology mediated query answering: quantifying over all possible (finite
extensions)
Characterization of skeleton for which queries have always finite examples of
non-satisfacton

## Relational databases
Semantic tractability of conjunctive queries
Can we rewrite a query to a query of a bounded tree-width

## Bounding the length of bad sequences in WQO
