# Preserving joins at primes

Every Boolean algebra corresponds to quotient space 

Take B Boolean algebra of regular languages. 
We take O-types giving a topological space S_o(MSO).
These spaces are relatively free profinite monoids.
Thm [Gherke, Pin]: that space admits a multiplication operation.

Operation K=>L words w such that for every $k\in K$ we have $kw\in L$.
They also have L=>K.

The duality is like taking powersets in one direction and carrier set in the
other direction.

applications, on Arxiv]

## Domains
directedlly complete partial orders

Def: D has enough join-primes

Thm: D has enough join-primes iff the dual space X is a domain with Scott
topology.

When is a Boolean algebra with <= and => dial to a topological algebra.

Def [Main] A fnction f: DxE -> F preserves joins at primes
(a=? b \or c) = (a=> b)\or (a=>c) is to strong, but here something weaker is
used.
