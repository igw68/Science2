# Ample sets

It turns out that what we are doing is sleep sets, but we do not do ample sets.

**The rule** if there is a process that can do a local action, and does not have
global actions (even disabled) then do just all the actions of this process.

**Q1** Is this optimal for client/server.
No it is not. 

This is not optimal for global/local but maybe it is with addition of simple
sleep sets.
