* A recent set of examples of applications is in [benchmarks-learningDFA.pdf]
  (paper from 2019). 
  They also discuss different approaches to learning finite automata.

  This algorithm uses prefixes to discover new states. Apparently original L*
  adds all prefixes

It looks like they cover all other known instances of learning, but for distributed

# Synthesis of Petri nets

  This a paper that gives an overview of the results. Always here the condition
  is that every transition has different label.
