* [2021-03-06] Meeting
  * POR1 vs CS
    * They have removed some deadlocks
    * They have added some covering for POR1
    * It is still much worse than local zone exploration.
  * Experiments POR1 vs POR3
    * POR1 is better for mixed states
  * She has not looked at POR5
  * Magnetic method
    * mixed states are considered as sync states
    * It looks like POR1 and POR3
  * Discuss the role of E
  * POR5, what is her idea and what is mine.
  * [TODO] Merge magnetic POR, and narrowing.
  * RR-POR
    * how to get more R actions: when changing a zone does not disable other actions
  * Examples on which to try RR POR
    * Fischer (all variants)
    * Lamport Fischer (problem as there are two variables)

* [2021-28-05] Meeting
  * Implement magnetic POR for experimenting
  * On "local plus comm" example, POR1 works better that POR3. Simulate this
    with magnetic POR
  * Do optimal POR with RR independence
