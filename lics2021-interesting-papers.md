# Grohe talk
1 dimensional coloring algorithm
Color refinement can be implemented very fast
Color refinement was originally designed as isomorphism test (count how many
nodes of each color there are at the end)
It is good but fails on very simple graphs.
Higher-dimension algorithm colors tuples of nodes. It is still not complete
isomorphic test. But it is a complete isomorphic test for every minor exclusion
class. For planar graphs we need dimension 3 to get isomorphic test.
Graphs are not distinguishable by k-dimensional algorithm iff they are
equivalent for logic C_k (FO with counting quantifiers on tuples)
