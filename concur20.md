# CONCUR20

Interesting talks

* Javier Esparza [[weak-asynchronous-models-for-distributed-comp]]

* Partially Observable Concurrent Kleene Algebra  6A 2nd, 13:00  Wed

* Abstraction, Up-To Techniques and Games for Systems of Fixpoint Equations 
  [[abstractions-for-systems-of-fixpoint-equations]]
  
* Reaching Your Goal Optimally by Playing at Random with No Memory 8A, 14:45 Wed

* Determinisability of One-Clock Timed Automata: Clemente, Lasota, Piorkowski
  * They consider when a nondeterministic TA can be made deterministic
    * It is in general undecidable, unless one fixes the number of clocks in the
      resulting DA.
    * For decidability they use automata with atoms
    * They show that separability of two TA by a deterministic TA is decidable
      if we fix the number of clocks in a separator.

* Deciding the Existence of Cut-Off in Parameterized Rendez-Vous Networks, Horn,
  Sangier
