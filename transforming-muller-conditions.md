# Transforming Muller conditions

Master thesis of Antonio about transforming automaton to the one with optimal
conditions.
They consider deterministic automata, but similar ideas apply also for games.

**Objective:** transform a Muller automaton to a parity automaton as small as
possible and with as small condition as possible.

They do Zielonka tree but for the loops that really exist in the given automaton
