Goals

# Andrzej
- Higher order matching
- Better leafy automata

# Fixpoints
- quickly calculating fixpoints
- a problem for [[antonio]]

# Corto [[corto]]
- token architectures: show decidability for well-nested locks


# Partial-order real-time
- find enough good examples to finish the paper on POR, read/write POR
- learn Tulip
- find a subject around dynamic POR (talk for IFIP meeting?)
- [[deterministic-real-time]]
  
# Negotiations
- Learning algorithm
  - Find a source of examples for the learning algorithm (Thomas Chatin)
  - Find out how to calculate S-components (Laure Petruci)
- Journal version of of LICS paper. 

# Higher-order MC
- finish journal paper, incorporate comparison with Tsukada
- Extensional collapse theorem
- [[project-lambda]]


# partial-order
- go back to partial-order work: can we get efficient optimal partial-order method
  
#Root
