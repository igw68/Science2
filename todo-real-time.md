# TODO real-time

## Journal CONCOUR'20 paper:
- invariants
- efficient inclusion test
- proofs that operations on local zones preserve local zones.
- by 14th of February

## Buchi real-time
- Assume given source function.
- Check if source function is compatible with subsumption
- It needs local region part that we do not need for LICS
- Check non-Zeno? Rather not
- In conclusions we can say that we can apply the same to games.
- We need one convincing example with source function done by hand.

## Adding symmetry ??
