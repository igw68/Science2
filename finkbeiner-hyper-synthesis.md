# Finkbeiner Hyper Synthesis

[finkbeiner-synthesis-hyper.pdf]

They consider universal hyper-properties $\forall_pi \forall_\rho
\psi(\pi,\rho)$
In order to solve this they show that S satisfies this property if S\times S
satisfies \psi. 
Then they encode constraints on existence of S in the SMT solver.

They have a BoSy tool, and HyperBoSy tool, for synthesis.

The interesting point is that they can synthesize *dining cryptographers.*
