# Strahler number

Discussion with Colcombet, Fijalkow, Antonio

+ Suppose we guess a number k. If we start Jurdzinskis algo on game with
  Strahler number k then the result is correct.
+ Actually it will find all the dominia of good Strahler number. 
+ Hypothesis: Can we re-color the game to get automatically Strahler number?
  + Maybe we need to double the number of positions.
  + More precisely: if we just solve the game then we get some decomposition.
    When do we get the smallest decomposition?
