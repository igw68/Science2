# Controlling negotiations

It looks reasonable to take nodes that are controllable or un-controllable
For strategies we have a choice between
* process based: causal past of a process
* action based: causal past of all the processes participating in a node

We should start from as simple setting as possible.
So we can assume that the negotiation (arena) is sound and determinisitc.
