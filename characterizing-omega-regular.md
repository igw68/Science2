Synthesis of strategies in 0-sum games on graphs (turn based)
Finite-memory controllers for infinite games (in what cases they suffice)

There is characterization of memoryless strategies of Hugo and Zielonka
Objective is a set of infinite sequences of colors

## Finite arenas
They are interested when both players have memoryless strategies.
THm [Gimbert Zielonka]
If W admits memoryless strategies for all one player arenas (for both players)
then it admits memoryless strategies for all arenas.

## Infinite arenas
Does the same theorem work for infinite arenas.
For some conditions that need no memory on finite games may need infinite memory
on infinite arenas.
[Niwinski & Colcombet] Has a characterization for prefix-independent objectives.
The only conditions are parity conditions (limsup) over finite no of colors.
This turns to be a consequence of techniques of Gimbert and Zielonka.

Q: can we remove the hypothesis of prefix-independence?

## Finite memory strategies
Memory is updated wrt to colors.
Strategy depends on state and memory
He wants a memory that is independent from arenas, allows to win in all games.
Prefix classifier: Mihyl-Nerode partition but for \omega-words as contexts

Thm: W is finite memory determinied iff W is omega-regular

Q: memoryless
Q: finite arenas
