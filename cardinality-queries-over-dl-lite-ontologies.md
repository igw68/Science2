# Cardinality Queries over DL-Lite Ontologies
Quentin Mani√®re


* Concepts and roles: S \incl S' or S\incl \bar S'
* There is quantification over firs argument of a role \exists R
* ABox: assertions A(a), S(a,b)
* Unique name assumption: two names denote different elements
* Canonical model: the most 

## Problem: How many pairs in S(a,b) there are?
Is there the same number in every model. 
For fixed query and ontology: given ABOx decide if we can decide how many
answers we have.
