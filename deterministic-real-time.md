# Deterministic Real-Time

This is about a conjecture of Sri that if a real-time language and its
complement are recognized by a timed automaton then they are recognized by a
deterministic timed automaton. 

This paper gives an analogous result for obrit finite languages:

Maybe understanding of timed languages through tree languages would help:

There is also a papre on deterministic one-clock automata at CONCUR'20
