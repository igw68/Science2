# A reduction approach to HOMC

Parys: article to appear in FSTTCS

Simple proof but only for reachability ATA. 
Q: compare to saturation algorithm with Lorenzo

First they make a product of a scheme and an automaton. This gives a scheme that
generates a tree generating all possible runs on a tree generated by the scheme.

Since it is reachability all paths	are finite ending with $\top$ or $\bot$.

They reduce the order by one. At every step the order grows exponentially.

Consider KL where is L of type 0. 
* either K accepts without L, or both K\top and L are accepting. This gives a
  boolean formula for transforming the tree.
  
Is this not the same as evaluating in the model with 2 elements?
