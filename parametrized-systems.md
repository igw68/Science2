# Parametrized systems

These are systems with arbitrary number of copies of the same component, and
maybe one copy of another component that we call leader.

Often every component is a finite automaton.

The important thing is the communication mechanism. 
* broadcast
* rendez-vous: of some process that does !a and some that does ?a
* sometimes there is an architecture, like ring, and every process communicates
  with its neighbours
* more complicated mechanisms as in Heard-Of model

studies when a system has a cut-off, namely a bound on the number of process
above which it always has a run from the initial to final configuration.
