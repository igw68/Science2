# Main points
- Look what Barbara Koenig does with fixpoints
- Higher-order poly-time by Ugo Dal Lago is quite nice
- Raskin's subgame equilibria are not that stupid
- Rob van Glabek on impossibility of mutual exclusion is very intriguing


## Rupak A theory of Resposibility allocation
The troley problem: what is more ethical option
The moral machine website
He wants to model this formally
How to attribute the outcome to agents that influence this outcome 
(get a weigth for every agent)
He uses turn-based partial information games.
First they assign responsibility to cooalitions: do they have a strategy to
prevent E?
Backward responsibility: when they have had at some moment a strategy to prevent
E.
How to compute reponsibility on each player: Von Neumann Morgenstern value.
This goes through Shapley value of the game.
The problem is full aggregation: kill one person or 5 people

## Barbara Koening Fixpoint theory upside down
[FOSSACS'21]
Fixpoints on a complete lattice
We want to approximate fixpoints from the other side f(l)<l then we know that
\mu f< l
Kleene iteration gives you the other approximation. 
They want usefull rules for l< mu f
Ex termination probability in a Markov chain is the least fixpoint.
How to tell the difference with the greatest fixpoint
Idea: compute the set of states taht still have some "slack". This can be done
on a "simpler" fixpoint computation.
Lattice M^Y where Y is finte, M is a MV chain.
They can go to powersets of Y to compte the fixpoint.
This gives some condition on approximations.
They rely on  the fact that they can produce approximation functions easily,
compositinally from some basic functions.
Non-bisimilarity of states: how they do this?

## Delia Kesner Mulit types for Higher-Order Lnaguages
Motivation: quantitativity 
Typing system measuring the size of the normal form
non-idempotent intersection types: gives upper bound 
There are models that give exactly the size of the result, and the lenght of the
derivation. [K & Viso'21]

# Christakis Testing program analysers
Matamorphic testing: change program in such a way that it should not influence
bugs (add a dead code)
She implemented query fuzz. They detected some deep semnatic bugs.
Then she applied the same method to SMT solvers.
Takes a set of formulas, a valuation, and constructs new formulas from
subformulas formulas that are satisfiable in the chosen valuation. 
Once again they have found many bugs

# Ugo dal Lago Higher-order crypto
Reduction is a higher-order function from a program breaking one primitive to a
program breaking another primitive.
They asume adversaries working in probabilistic polynomial time. 
Ex: hashing which is equivalence preserving, equivalent programs have the same
hash. (curiosity)
The length of the game should be poly bounded, and the strategy should be
bounded by polynomial (this is a notion for first-order function on strings).
This notion has good closure structure.
Delicate point about how to extend into randomized strategies: they need to
introduce explicit random bit oracle.
THere is no highier-order pseudo-random function

# Andrzej Murawski Compositional RElational reasoning
Higher-order computations with state
Constraints on languages translate on constraints on plays in the game semantics
This is done with function and continuation names that are generated at almost
every moves. This determines pointers. 
Then the differences between the languages are captured by how names are
inherited.
So they have LTS that can be used to prove equivalences. 
They get full abstraction results it tems of LTSs

# Alberto Lluch-Lafuente, Theory of decentralized finance
Formal executable semantics for money exchange platforms.
They model these with transition systems: state are walets + other things
Q: How do you specify this transition system?
Q: Where do you get information how a particular platform works?
Many challenges concerning possible attack scenarios

# Jerome Leroux PN reachability

# Raskin Subgame perfect equilibtium in mean-payoff games
Q: what do we know for mean-payoff inter parity
  Rational verification is to see if all optimal paths satisfy a given parity
  condition
	What about computing the best value while winning parity condition?
There are n players, each has some vertices of the graph. 
What are sequences that can occur if players play rationally. 
Nash equilibria are not very reasonable in this setting. 
We also require that player also aims for Nash equilibium in evey subgame.
They want to decide if a game has a subgame Nash equilibium
Wooldrige rational verificaiton setting
Theorem: a very clean characterization of paths that appear on Nash equilibria.
Now they use an iteration on the lambda funcftions defining Nash equilibria.
To get the fixpoint of this iteration they need to see that it is piecewise
linear.
They use this for parity specifictions (NP-complete problem).

# Rob van Glabbeek Mutual exclusion
There is no such thing as a correct mutual exclusion protocol           
(speed-independent, and atomic)
Examples of protocols: Peterson and Lamport bakery protocol (drop these
assumptions)
Requirements: mutex, starvation freedom, plus other four requirements that he
distilates (like not forcing a process to mutex)
The correctness rquirements cannot be formulated in temporal logics
M6: if a process is ready to make a request it will make a request. (this avoids
faireness assumption)
[Dijkstra'65] Nothing can be assumed about relative speed of the process
competing for access to the critical section. 
Atomicity: a second memory access is only possible after the first is completed.
Lamport: allows overlaps, but apparently atomicity is actualy a harder
assumption.
