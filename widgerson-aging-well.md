# Widgerson aging well


1936 birth of algorithm
1971 Efficiency, time, space, completeness
Questions: 
* Is theory relevant for practice
* Are we mathematicians of computer scinece?
* Do models need real life motivations?
* Are asymptotic bounds usefull

Mission: educate about impact of theoretical computer scinece

[Book: Mathematics + Computation his web site]

Big impact: Methodology for studying computation
Computation is everywhere, bacteria, stock market, ..
We have enormous number of connections to other disciplines, but we are
independent discipline. 

Math vs CS: 
* tension between practice/utility and aesthetics abstraction
* tension between performance beauty

Theories created language and tools to design current computing systems (crypto
is a striking example)

P=NP is one of the deepest questions ever asked

He underlines MIP*=RE result from the last year. (quantum provers)

## Lower bounds through algorithms
PIT: polynomial identity testing

Advocates to understand what has been done in the past and understand the flow
of ideas. Internalize and build on it.

We do not have any superlinear lower bound for any problem in NP.
