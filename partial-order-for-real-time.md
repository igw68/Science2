# Partial Order for Real Time

There is a log of activities [[log-partial-order-for-real-time]]

The work with Sarah is in [[sarah-parital-order]]

We need examples to show that bounded spread is useful

Ideas:
* [[ample-sets]]
* [[adding-synchronization-actions]]
* [[stateless-exploration]] 
* [[por-without-annotations]]
* POR on 0-time fragment of the graph

[[partial-order-examples]]

Spin (to learn how it manages POR)
* Spin exercises and examples: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/Exercises.html
* More models:  http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~albl/promela.html
* A tutorial on Spin: http://spinroot.com/spin/Doc/SpinTutorial.pdf

Some other directions
* Bounded model-checking [[thiagu]]
* [[timed-unfoldings]]
