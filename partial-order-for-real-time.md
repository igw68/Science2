# Partial Order for Real Time

There is a log of activities [[log-partial-order-for-real-time]]

The work with Sarah is in [[sarah-parital-order]]

We need examples to show that bounded spread is useful. 
We can invent any POR we want as we can say that in future we will do dynamic
POR that infers dependencies on the fly [Flanagan and Godfroid].

To read:
* Lamport's "Real-time model checking is really simple" [Lamport2005_Chapter_Real-TimeModelCheckingIsReally.pdf]
  There is a longer version as research report [lamport-real-simple.pdf]
	

Ideas:
* [[ample-sets]]
* [[adding-synchronization-actions]]
* [[stateless-exploration]] 
* [[por-without-annotations]]
* POR on 0-time fragment of the graph

Spin (to learn how it manages POR)
* Spin exercises and examples: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/Exercises.html
