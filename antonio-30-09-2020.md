1. Continue stage [[transforming-muller-conditions]]
   * Arbre de Zielonka done un minimal pour reconaitre la condition de Muller
   * Traduction de automate de Muller a automate de Zielonka.
     * On regardant les cycles dans automate
   * Applications pour determinization
     * Plus petit que la construction Schewe
   * If automaton can have both Rabin and Streett condition it is Parity
   * Q: good for games
   1. Extend this to games
   2. Can we do similar thing in PTIME? Constructing Zielonka is PSPACE.
2. Quasi-poly for Rabin
3. Memory for conditions given by an automaton. $LA^*$
   1. Automaton on finite words, accepting with prefix? They know how to do for safety
   2. He has a report on it.
   3. Kopczynski a fait qqch: only chromatic memory (reads only colors); he
      gives an exhaustive set of arenas to test.
   4. Uniform/non-uniform strategy may depend of vertex where we start.   
   5. They fusion some states of minimal det automaton for $L$.
   6. Conjecture: If we cannot fusion wrt to relation they have then all states
are needed for memory.
4. Small games for Zielonka trees.
5. Structural comparison of systems: bisimulations, morphisms
   1. We are interested in cycles in automata
   2. What about bisimulations instead of locally surjective morphisms
  
Can there be two several minimal automata wrt to morphism with different number
of states?

* The last algorithm of Jurdzinski.
