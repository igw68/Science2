# Holonomic techniques
Jouel Ouknine

A sequence is holonomic when it is a recursive sequence with polynomial
coefficients. 
The order is the number of terms in the recursive equation.
So a holonomic sequence is defined by a recursion and initial values (as many as
the order of the sequence)

They are closed under sum, multiplication, Cauchy product, shift, summation

Thm: Equality of holonomic sequences is decidable.

Holnomic functions: defined by a differential equation.

Thm: Equality of holonomic functions is decidable.

Here he looks at deciding inequalities: u_n>=v_n? decicing u_n>=0 for all n?

He is interested in "analytic" properties of holonomic sequences. Saying this is
a largely unexplored territory.
