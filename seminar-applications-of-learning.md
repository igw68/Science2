# Seminar Applications of learning

[ISBERNER, 2015 gives an overview]

For equivalence testing they use probabilistic algorithm.

## Applications
TCP protocol, Vaandrager 2016. They need abstraction to reduce alphabet size.
[vaandragen-tcp-fragments.pdf]

## Open
Learning for timed automata: apparently they are interested
Learning for many components: [Vaandragen LATA 2021, somebody TACAS 2020]
