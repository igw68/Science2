# Synthesis round-table Simons 2021

# Orna Kupferman

- The very important challenge is compositionally.
  - to verify conjunction we just check each component, this is not possible for
    synthesis.
  - It is also connected to explainability
- The other issue is quality.

# Ezio Bartocci

- Program synthesis for non-expert programmers (FlashFill)
- SyGuS Syntax-Guided Program Synthesis
- Model repair/Parameter synthesis Tools for Probabilisitic Models
- Counter example guided inductive syntehsis for Prob Progaram [Andruishenko TACAS'21]
- Superoptimization (rapid exploration of the space of all programs)
- Intrepretable Program Synthesis [Zhang, CHI 2021 (Computer Human Interaction 21)]

# Hadas Kress-Gazit

- Synthesis for robotics
- LTL is not enough because we need timing, distances, quality, robustness.

# Sumit Gulwani

- specification reduction: synthesize from as few examples as possible
- [SIGMOD'20] Web Data Extraction

# Armando Solar-Lezama (MIT)

- Helping people to write tricky low-level code turned out to be less helpful
  than expected (appart from very tricky bit manipulation code)
- Where is works is when you target very specific tasks (improvement of existing
  implementations)
- Reverse engineering: from implementation to high-level description
  - Machine learning and synthesis
