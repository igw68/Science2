# negotiations vs series parallel languages

Is there some relation between languages of sound deterministic negotiations and
series parallel languages? 

At first there is no inclusion in any direction.
In series parallel we can have $(a^{2n}b^{2n}c)+(a^{2n+1}b^{2n+1}c)$.
This is impossible in negotiations (sound deterministic). 

The example above shows also why series-parallel languages are not determined by their path languages. 

On the other hand every trace is a language  of a negotiation and there are many traces that are not series parallel.
