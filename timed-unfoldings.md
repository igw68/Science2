# Timed unfoldings

There are problems with PO methods for Zielonka automata. But they go away for
unfolding method as there is unique unfolding. 

So we can consider acyclic timed automata and construct an event structure
decorated with local zones that describes all the behaviors.  

There are two papers on unfolding timed automata. Both are not using
local time, but use read arcs. It remains to be seen why and how.
