# Verification of learned stochastic automata

#seminar 2022-02-17
Baouya Abdelhakim 
Expose catastrophe: il n'ai pas de comprehension de son probleme.

[Peled 2002, Black box checking]
[Naskos Athanasios et al, 2016, Online analysis of security risks in elastic
cloud applications] Building automata model
Incomprehensible his explanations
[Mao H. Larsen, Learning deterministic probabilistic automata from
model-checking perspective]
Once again incomprehensible explanation
[Aichernig, Tappler Black-box reachability checking, 2019]

He uses stochastic BIP (as he is a post-doc in Verimag)
Bad explanation of BIP

## His approach
He does something like Mao and Larsen but in BIP?
He just explains symbols on slides

## Statistical model-checker
