# Deciding the Existence of Cut-Off in Parameterized Rendez-Vous Networks

Paper of Horn and Sanglier at [[concur20]]

They study a new decision problem: given a network does it have a cut-off
* rendez-vous, one leader and some number of clients, every node is a finite state automaton.
* pair-wise synchronization: two components synchronize on a give letter.
	Since there are finitely many letters, one cannot control communication
	too much.
* They want to see if they can go from a conf where everybody is in the
	initial state can go to everybody in the finial state. (when there are
	more participants than some bound)
* Simultanous reachability in PN: can you reach M' from M, and can you reach
	M from M'
* It is rather trivial to simulate their model by a PN. The boundedness
	problem they introduce is rather artificial. It is not clear how to solve
	it though. They give a method based on the semilinearity results for PNs
* If there is no leader then the bound is easier to find. Quite nice
	argument showing that if C^m_{init} -> C^m_{fin}, and similarly for {m+1},
	then m*m is a cut-off.
