# Learning asynchronous automata given gossip information for free

This looks quite hopeless as there is no canonical form.
Consider two processes that need to calculate at the end that the length is
divisible by something. The processes synchronize on all letters, so gossip is
not needed. Then we need to find out how to distribute information as a product
of two states.
