# Govind defense
[[2021-06-16]]

## For Thomas: 
	* Q: process mining with van der Alst. Does he still have a contact with him?
## For Laure: 
	* Her CAV'18 paper "Quasi optimal"
	* Q: Complexity of finding alternaitves
	* Q: She has an impressive number of examples. How they have done this?


## Questions
* Shared clocks. What happens in this case? There should be a reduction to make
  clocks disjoint.
* Laure is interested in parametric timed automata. What is this?
* Thomas: When we translate timed PN to timed automat you get invariants
  everywhere. He is surprised by the result that allows to eliminate them. 
* Test how eliminating invariants influences the performance for checking
  reachability. 
* Transforming a model to spread bounded model. 
* When we get finite local zone graphs without subsumption (when we do not have cycles)
* Symmetry reduction
* [Silvano] Encoding preemption by shifting local time. This apparently is much
  simpler than stop-watches, when you know what is the execution time of a task.
* Clocks evolving at different rates at different processes: is local semantics
  is better for treating this case. 
* Is spread-boundedness decidable? We show that it is PSPACE-hard. 


* Thomas: partial answer to partial-order reduction
* Tenacy of Govind through this difficult period.
