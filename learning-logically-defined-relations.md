# Learning logically defined relations

#seminar Grohe 28/05

Nice setting for learning of logical formulas.

He learns formulas on graphs using Gaifman locality property.

He learns formulas on words but here he cannot do it with local access (seeing
only neighbors of a position). He needs to build a factorization forest (Simons
theorem gives a constant height forest).
