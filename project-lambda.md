# Project: lambda

- [ ] Write a journal version of Ranked Lambda including infinite models
See how it reads to decide whether to send it to JACM or LMCS
- [ ] Extensional collapse theorem. This is the next thing that can be exiting in the subject
For this maybe I should recontact Charles Grelois
- [ ]Understand program of Helmut
- [ ] Show ranked lambda to Thomas Ehrhad. He says in his resume for SAutomne2018 that he works on models for simply typed Y with two fixpoints.
