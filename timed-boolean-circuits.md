# Timed boolean circuits

These are models from Ocan's CAV'19 paper. We do not know how to use POR on
them.

We suppose that the circuit is a tree. 
* We make a product of all components in one subtree and in the other, we make a root a server.
* The gain is that we remove all interleavings between actions in different subtrees.
