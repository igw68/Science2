# applications-of-learning

[leucker-leargning-survey.pdf] apparently there are some applications there
(from 2007)

[benchmarks-learningDFA.pdf]
Lists s some applications of learning

A rather big application is in 
[learning-heuristics-for-equivalence-test.pdf]
There they also discuss how to implement Teacher

Application of learning to verification of recurrent neural networks. 
Finkel's paper. Not looked inside
[learning-and-neural-networks.pdf]
It would be nice if negotiations were better model to learn than finite automata
in this context.

A seminar of Silva on her 2021 paper: [[model-learning]]

* TCP protocol, Vaandrager 2016. They need abstraction to reduce alphabet size.
* In a recent survey of Bengt Jonsson he gives some examples of applications of learning.

**Cryptography can be particularly interesting for us as there should be obvious independence relations between parties.**  

There is SIGCOMM'21 paper of Alexandra Silva, that is not yet available.
