* Is  [[schedulability-frederics-example]] 0-spread
  It looks like it is almost. Frederic will try to abstract a simpler example
  and analyze it.
* Introducing synchronization actions [[adding-synchronization-actions]]
  * It is by far not obvious how to do it, as this action should be eager: all
    processes should do it once it is available. Such an action is not
    compatible with partial order.
