# Logics with concrete domains

Stephane Demri 

Concrete domain is a relational structure.
He considers seqeuences over these relational structures. 
Such a sequence defines a symbolic model (sequence of sets of atomic predicates
holding at each position).

## constrained automata 
transitions are labeled by a constraint over x_1,..,x_k, and Xx_1,.., Xx_k

## OVer $R,<,=$ this is easy
there are two natural conditions for satisfiability of symbolic models

## finite strict length condition for $(N,<)
They use bounding quantifier to express this condition.
It is enough to take a decidable fragment of MSO+B.
Q: What about N? He has decidability for Z?

## N-automata
Thm [Segufin, Trounczyk]: The emptiness for (N,<) automata is PSAPCE-complte


## Approach through ultimately periodic models
