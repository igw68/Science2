# Active Learning


* [[applications-of-learning]]
* [[learning-and-model-checking]]


## Variants of the classical active learning algorithm
* [[angluin-learning]]
* [[ttt-learning-algorithm]]
* [[other-learning-algorithms]]
* PAC learning finite automata is impossible [[pac-learning-finite-automata]]

## Extensions
* [[learning-nfa]]
* [[learning-series-parallel-pomsets]]
* [[learning-mscs]]
* [[calf-project.org]] Different algebraic learning
* [[learning-timed-automata]] 
* [[learning-with-implicaitons]]
* [[synthesis for network programs]]


## Applications
- A recent set of examples of applications is in [benchmarks-learningDFA.pdf]  (paper from 2019). 
## Some variations
* [[never-stop-learning]]

## Some directions
* [[learning-automata-with-diamonds]]
* [[learning-asynchronous-automata-given-gossip-information-for-free]] quite impossible
* [[Learning timed automata]] apparently people would like to do it
