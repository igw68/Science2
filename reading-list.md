## Efficient and Dynamic Algorithms for Alternating B¨uchi Games and Maximal End-Component Decomposition

## Optimal labelling schemes for adjacency, comparability and reachability, STOC'21
[optimal-labeling.pdf]
They label nodes of a graph so that the labels of nodes determine if there is an
edge between two nodes (or a path between two nodes).
They have the best labelling scheme for reachability. 
The first step is to construct the SCC graph. 
Then they label the skeleton of SCC graph.
Finally, every node gets a label from the skeleton plus the name of SCC (log(n)
bits).

## Rust programming language 
[rust-programming-language.pdf]
Rust uses linear types and ownership mechanism to prevent data races.
