# FO separation over countable ordinals
Remi Morvan

FO separanility for finite words [Henckell'88, Almeida'96] more simple [Place,
Zeitoun'16]

For omega-words: [Perrin'84] for definablility and [Place-Zeitoun'16] for
separability

Here ordinals. Decidability [Bedon'01]. Here he shows separability

Separability is solved by computing an object SAT in a monoid recognizing the
two languages. This object is an element of a powerset monoid P(M). 
There are rules for constructing this object: 
- we take all the singletons
- we close under concatenation. 
- we can take union of some number of elements if they form a group in the
  powerset monoid.

Finitary ordinal monoid (M,\cdot, ^\w) + axioms saying how ^\w works wrt
concatenation. [Bedon'98]

[Bedon'01] characterizes FO-definability by aperiodic \omega-monoitds

They show that the same saturation works for omega words.
