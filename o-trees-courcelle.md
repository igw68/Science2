## ordered words
a countable order with a labelling of each element with a letter
There is a natural concatenation of orders
Regular terms: those that have finite number of distinct subterms
Thm: arrrangement is regular iff it is definable in MSOL
In other words a term is a tree and the order is given by the order on leaves.

## O-trees
Ordered forest: Ordered set with {x>=y} is linearly ordered for every y.
o-tree: when every two elements have an upper bound
joint-trees: every set has an upper bound.

line: interval of a path
axis: path till the root

Operations on trees with axes. Depending on where is axis it is either one after
the other or one next to another
Defining trees with a principal regular axis to which it are atteched finitely
many other types of trees. 
Thm: A O-tree is regular iff it is MSO_fin definable.
