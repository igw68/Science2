# Learning series-parallel pomsets

There is paper of Alexandra Silva from TACAS 21 for series parallel pomsets.
[learning-pomset-automata-fossacs21.pdf]

Pascal says that bounded width pomsets behave much better. One could check what happens for them.

What about learning general pomesets? 

It is also not clear how to learn general pomset automata. Silva learns automata
only indirectly through bi-monoids.

A talk about this paper [[learning-pomset-automata]]
