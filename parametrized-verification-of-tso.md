# Parametrized verification of TSO

[Parameterized Verification under TSO is PSPACE-Complete, Parosh Abdulla, Atig,
POPL'20]

They consider any number of identical processes with a shared memory. Memory
access is TSO. They show reachability to be PSPACE-complete. Decidability of the
problem was already known. [Abdulla et al. 2018a]

There is nice summary of old research on the subject. 

The result itself has a tedious proof, that I have not looked at.

They do not know how to include the leader. How to do more than reachability.
